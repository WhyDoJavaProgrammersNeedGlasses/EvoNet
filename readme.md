This is a now abandoned project which tried to reimplement [the code](https://github.com/pampersrocker/EvoNet/) of a [video series called EvoNet](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL58qjcU5nk8u4Ajat6ppWVBmS_BCN_T7-) in Java, which as the name implies tries to simulate evolution with relatively naive AI agents. 

It was implemented without any machine learning libraries and lacked any kind of GUI.
